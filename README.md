# vim-hexdec

This vim plugin lets you convert hexadecimal numbers to decimal counterparts
and vice versa by exposing following functions:

- `:Hex2dec`
- `:Dec2hex`

The functions work for visual selection as well.

The plugin doesn't define any bindings and leaves the choice to the user.

Based on http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Convert_between_hex_and_decimal.
